openMSX TSX Linux Advanced Mod (x64 edition) by DrWh0 & imulilla Beta 2
=======================================================================


*** ENGLISH TRANSLATION NOT SO GOOD DUE TO LACK OF TIME ***

SORRY ABOUT IT BUT I AM VERY TIRED AT THE TIME OF WRITING THIS.

** SEE ADDITIONAL NOTES IF YOU ARE USING THIS SCRIPT IN RASPBERRI PI **


INTRODUCTION:
=============

I have written this script to provide the best MSX emulation available
in these moments for GNU / Linux.

Additionally, the use and installation for all types of users has been
made as easy as possible.

Lots of the planned improvements are included for the next official 
version of openMSX but also this package consists of the following 
features:

01.- Script for pseudo portable installation in current user's profile
02.- Only the essential dependencies are installed as the system (root)
03.- Auto installation of the dependencies of the own menu "on the fly"
04.- Optional installation of spanish translation of internal OSD
05.- Auto download and installation of the "systemroms" in the emulator
06.- Clean uninstall of this version without touching the systemr
07.- Installation of libraries post 18.04 but compatible
08.- Installation of latest openMSX in Ubuntu 18.04 & derivatives
09.- Support of files in .TSX format (openMSX TSX fork)
10.- IPS support integrated in .TSX container file (TSX Advanced)
11.- Fedora support (*should* work, not tested too much)
12.- Modular code with comments to help you create your own scripts
13.- Transparent MOD "Raspbian compatible"
14.- Linux Mint 19.3, Ubuntu 18.04 support (included Raspberry PI)
15.- Fedora Linux support versions 30 and up
16.- GIT Download, Cloning and compiling from official GIT server


IMPORTANT:
==========

The openMSX team HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS SOFTWARE OR THE TSX FORKS.

DON'T ANNOY THEM IF YOU FIND A BUG CONTACT WITH THE RESPECTIVE AUTHORS

ONLY FEDORA AND MINT/UBUNTU 18.04 ARE SUPPORTED 

POSSIBLY WORKS IN DEBIAN & OTHER DISTROS VIA REPOSITORIES

If you want support for your distribution you must change the calls 
of your package manager and offline dependencies for your distribution
if you are interested contact me in order to implement and test those
changes.


Requirements:
=============

- Ubuntu 18.04 / Linux Mint 19.3 (Not tested in other versions)
- Fedora 30/31
- 64 bit only (no openMSX TSX Advanced 32-bit binaries at the moment)
- 32 bit OS possibly work via repositories (included dependencies are x64)
- The hardware required to install the aforementioned Linux distributions
- The packages: "dialog" "pv" and "unzip" (the menu detects & installs it)


How to use this script:
=======================


From console (english):

./lanzador-mint-english.sh (If you use Mint / Ubuntu)
./launcher-fedora-english.sh (If you use Fedora)

If it did not launch and only the file was displayed make sure to do:

From console:

chmod + x ./launcher-mint.sh (If you use Mint / Ubuntu)
chmod + x ./launcher-fedora.sh (If you use Fedora)

And it will work for you

From the graphical environment:

If you use GNOME 3 you will have to change the behavior of the file 
manager before asking if to run the text scripts or view them because 
by default it only opens the text editor.

To change the default behavior:

Open the file manager (Click on the left in "Activities" -> "Files")

When you have it open:

3 lines button in the upper right bar-> Behavior and select:

- Ask what to do (that is, check the box and then click the close icon)

Pressing double click will ask you whether to run or view it.

ALWAYS choose:

"RUN IN A TERMINAL"

In the event that you clicked only on "run" nothing will appear as it is 
understood by a terminal = false and since it is a terminal program it 
will not be displayed.

If you want everything to work correctly, please read this help file.

Also make sure they have the ".sh" execution permissions:

For it:

Right click on the file-> Properties-> Permissions

* Check "Allow this file to run as a program"

* Select in ALL the dropdowns in "Access" -> "Reading and writing"


Some additional notes:
======================

No built-in exception catching features yet

In order to increase performance and avoid errors during compilation
in Raspberry Pi is almost mandatory to change vm.swappiness value to 10.
